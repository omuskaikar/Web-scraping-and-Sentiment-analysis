      "I'm using iPhone from 3GS generation. I have upgraded my iPhones every year since then. People might say its costly, but to be honest it justifies each & every single penny spent on it. It's a craftsmen masterpiece. Though it does not gives alot of features which other flagship phones do in this segment in the market, but honestly think do we really use those features in real time usage. iPhone makes your regular task so easy & simple which is their primary focus (Make user experience as simple & useful as possible). Its so fluid & fast compared to any flagship phones available in the market. Their software & hardware works seamlessly that it make the users experience alot easier & faster. Its single core scores outperforms the latest flagship of Google, samsung & one plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you thinking for an upgrade from 5s/6 or 6S then its worth doing mainly for the below reasons -\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Camera lovers would love the new 12 mp camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture on the iPhone which supports low light photography & optical image stabilization (included now in iPhone 7 too). The front facing camera is now 7 mp HD camera . It has a Quad-LED true tone flash.The pictures are so realistic & clear. The best in the market right now.\n",
      "2) iPhone is now finally IP67 certified - dust and water resistant\n",
      "3) Memory - Now available in 32/128/256 GB for the same price as previously for 6s 16/64/128GB respectively.\n",
      "4) New A10 fusion chip is extremely fast & the graphics output is incredible like a game console.\n",
      "5) Battery has been increased from 1715 mAh to 1960 mAh giving you about 2 hrs more battery life than 6s. My phone last 1 entire day with heavy usage.\n",
      "6) iPhone 7 now has Quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM & iPhone 7plus with 3GB of RAM.\n",
      "7) Stereo speakers are really amazing with good sound quality output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction of new colours to the iPhone rage has given one more reason to buy. My personal favourite is the matte black one (though the Jet black looks more appealing than the matte black one) , but the matte black is less prone to scratches & figure prints than the Jet Black.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pre-ordered my iPhone 7 first time on any online site but & I must say Flipkart made it a real amazing one. The delivered me my Phone the very next day of its release in India when people where standing in line outside the store to get one.\n",
      "They made it special by giving the customer a cadbury & shooting the customers expressions while unboxing their iPhones.\n",

The biometric thumb scanner is fast but does not beat the top of end Androids but is the best in Apple's own world. Display is HD Retina and best at 326 ppi as compared to any other. Battery juice is 2 to 3 hrs more and the Camera clarity is the best of all. You get the best of shots like a 21 mp digicam.

      "Camera - This is undoubtedly the best camera you have on any IP and just next to Samsung S7\n",
      "Display - Even if it is not quad HD or something, when you put other IPs in the side, the diff will be very obvious. A very pleasant display. A warm touch to the display feels pretty nice to look at. And also the quad HD screens have their bads.\n",
      "Speakers - not Stereo but way too loud\n",
      "Finger print - Now with this one, press and lift your finger as fast you can and the phone will be unlocked. We tested it on IP6, IP6S and IP7 and you can guess the winner.\n",

      "Its water resistant also. I put my 70K phone in a mug of water with heavy heart (as apple does not include water damage in warranty) but nothing happened.\n",

      "Performance - It will beat any phone by huge margins. A cute little stealthy black beast.\n",

      "IP7 - The Bads.\n",
      "Battery - It's not bad, I will say but it would have been a bit bigger. Best thing is if you are not using your phone, battery will not drain.\n",
      "Fast Charging - This is needed in any phone today\n",
      "Headphone Jack - USB Jack is pretty awesome, but the downside is that if you are low on battery and it's charging, you can't put headphones for music or calls. You have to wait for sometime. Or may be buy a bluetooth headphone.\n",

But then, it's all worth the effort! The camera is really good. Works amazing in low light today. And the sound output is simply amazing! Navigation super fast!

When I started using Apple I phone then i realized why they cost more than any other smartphone. They have terrific after sale support. My phone was heating a bit for Initial 2 days, then i contacted apple customer service through chat and phone support and they solved my queries .Apple has unique feature of adapting when we first start to use the phone and that's why in initial days it will heat a bit to get with the envrm and it was true. Now I don't feel like using other phone's ,I phone are light weight and this u can feel once u start using this gem device. Camera is above par no other phones comes close to pic quality than I phone 7 .Finally I must say if you have not used I phone , Use it for once you will surely not regret. Thanks.!!\n",

      "It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solace in the fact that I got the Black variant which sets it apart from the earlier generations. Having said that, the accumulation of the incremental updates is what makes this a significant step up from the 6s - IP67 protection, cleaning up of antenna lines, camera with better low light performance and OIS, stereo speakers, brighter screen with wider colour gamut, 40% faster quad core CPU, hexa core GPU and the bigger 1960 mAh battery. However, the focus will be more on what has been lost, namely, the headphone jack and the physical Home button. Coming from Android phones with capacitive only buttons, the latter doesn't matter at all, especially since it is now a multi-function button that does a lot more than the physical one. However, I must admit that pressing it felt odd initially and I mistook the vibration as flexing of the case in which my phone was encased. The loss of the former however will not be an easy one. It may have been a courageous move but also a bit impractical. I use a Sony SBH54 Bluetooth headset and the audio quality is still some way off to justify using it all the time. It is even more antagonizing when you have invested a significant amount in purchasing high-end 3.5mm jack headphones. At least, there is the headphone adapter which comes only in white and goes very well (not!) with the Black variant. I guess that is a compromise I have to live with and really hope that Apple has made the Lightning port a lot sturdier. I can somehow accept this decision if indeed, as Apple has stated, it was a price to pay for a larger battery, water resistance and stereo speakers without ruining the dimensions, even though I can accept an additional 2mm of thickness any day. Apart from the device itself, you buy yourself in to a large repertoire of accessories that simply dont exist for other devices.\n",

      "As far as iOS is concerned, Apple has been more forthright about picking up whats good in others (as has Android) which means a more accelerated rate of iOS progression compared to an approach of deterrence through suing. Also, Apples walled garden now has a pet door with overtures to developers to utilize aspects of iOS that were previously, preciously locked away. iOS also continues to be the platform of choice for innovative app developers who are not simply targeting income through baited ad clicks. Even Google and Microsoft continue to offer an incredible experience on iOS which is inexplicably better than what they offer on their own platform. It is perhaps not contestable that iOS offers the best security, privacy, optimization and consistency of any phone, even though most of it comes from Apples control of every aspect of the device. Also, the exclusivity of the OS has some appeal to it at a time when Android can be experienced on any PC. To sum it up, you cannot go wrong with buying the iPhone, unless you had to take out a mortgage to finance one.\n",

      "\n",
      "The iPhone 7 is a wondrous device with slick animations, gorgeous design, and compelling hardware - but it does come with its niggles - especially for people coming from Android. The first nick is the lack of convenient transitioning software (the move to iOS feature kept crashing on me for some reason) - so you have to start off by manually doing everything again - the same way you've been doing for the last 15 years or so. So say anything you want about technology but some things aren't changing here either. Now that we know that we have to feed all contacts manually to avoid complex data inconsistencies, you think of leaving that for last and install the super handy Trucaller app in the meantime - ONLY TO REALIZE MOMENTS LATER THAT TRUCALLER ON iOS DOES NOT SHOW A LIVE CALLER ID THE WAY IT DOES ON ANDROID - which essentially means you're left feeling completely embarrassed for the first few moments of any call you take if not the entirety of the call - AFTER which you can check the number MANUALLY and lament your lack of better judgment during a call.\n",

Nothing to say about iphone 7.. it's really sleek and black model looks hot in hand. Live picture is looks nice. Camera took pics like they are live. Battery backup it really gd, I use it for 2days once it changed full. Bt I hv little disappointed bcz I bought it in a price of Rs.45K where flipkart was giving it in Rs.40K jst little days ago. Nevertheless, I'm happy to gv 5K extra bcz I got it on my bday frm my beloved one. Thnk u flipkart to mk my bday spl. Lv u iphone 7.\n",

      "Battery is as usual typical iPhone battery. Older user will be knowing that. But what's interesting is iPhone is now waterproof and that too under 1m for about 30 mins as claimed by company.\n",
      "Though its waterproof, everything looks great after we dip it in water but a small very small change is noticed in its speaker. The sound then is a little awkward. Camera is impressive and clear. 3d home button feels to another level. Actually feels something premium in hand.\n",
      "In the box contents are same as usual the charging adapter and the lightening cable of same length, no change in that. But what's differnt is new lightening earpods. Yaa they now use lightening ports to insert earpods and they do give a lightening to headphone jack 3.0 which makes all headphones compatible with it. But that's really funny to carry adapters for earphones these days and always remain on brim of loosing. Also you can't charge and use the earpods on the same port because there is only single port now for both stuff's.\n",

I was very confused about buying an iPhone from Flipkart or any online shopping site as many people had wrote on review about the product being not genuine, received only the box, received open pack or a used product,etc... In the other hand if I go to apple store, the price is going to be pretty high with no exchange offer. So I had to take a risky chance and I took it. Ordered the phone on 22nd Jan 2018 after 4 pm and received a well packed Genuine iPhone on 23rd 9am, yeah thats right just on the next day. I was overwhelmed by the service provided by Flipkart.

Delivery person was patient enough and also created a video of the unboxing, in case things go sideways. But after all said and done, I am really happy.

      "1) battery is only 1930mah so we have to charged twice a day as I am a moderate user. Apple has to improve in this aspect,\n",
      "2) and about cam in day light it takes excellent photos both front and back but in low light conditions it gives blured images less detail in the photography. another draw back is removing head phone jack it is little bit embrace the users\n",
      "3) no fast charge it takes 2 hours to charge completely. These are the cones of this device I noticed.\n",
      "Now we talk about pros.\n",
      "1) excellent memory management even it has only 2 gb ram for booting the device it take nearly 20 to 30 seconds only.\n",
      "2) about processor it is a a10fusion chip no words excellent till now I didn't notice any lag in this device.\n",
      "3)video quality it is awesome it is capable of taking 4k video 30fps due to optical image stabilization we take excellent videos like dslr.\n",
      "4) camera is one of the major highlet in this device I noticed Samsung s7 edge and my Sony z3 + images to be frank this images are over saturated but in iPhone it gives natural look I.e what u see with u r eye exactly same in picture but it capture more details then above mentioned devices.\n",
      "5)finally it is one of the best device in the market it is equal to 6gb oneplus 5t speed In some aspect it is More than that.......\n",

      "I have serched over all enternet for buying an iphone 7 i cheked many shopping sites reviews and all customers feedbacks and after talking with many friends finally i get that many friends buyed mobile from flipkart and they got authentic mobiles so i finally decided to buy from flipkart and at same time i listened about big 10 sale and i ordered at exect time for cod and i got it only for 39,999rs. Then i waited for 4 days and i got that product i have doubt in mind that i have buyed it online and also at time of sale, it will be authentic\\real,then after payment i directly went with that box to inspire and unboxed their by recording full video by my mobile and then i have got a first look of mobile which is fresh look and looking perfectly new mobile my first doubt was cleared that it is not an empty box and not a box with a stone. Then they started mobile and checked all accessories and then said it is 100% real and then he activated my mobile and now I am enjoying it without any problem if any problem occurred in feature then their is warranty I can contact inspire(apple store) easily as it has all rights that any iPhone has. Thank you flip kart. Really 100% authentic. You can also search me on instagram I am student and really I got iPhone 7 at lowest price and as much as authentic as any other real iPhone in world.\n",

      "Delighted to have my hands on the very first day of iPhone 7 launch in india . As contrary to rumors this new iPhone is a whole new power house as compare to older versions ,6s or 6 . It's really fast and new home button with Taptic Engine gives you a whole new experience. I loved the texture of color black as it gives a whole unified feeling to the form factor . The camera is just amazing and better . There is lot to explore which I might update here in the review . The only thing which I did not like that much was the packaging of accessories in cardboard molds, it's very unlike apple . On an overall basis go for it and you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "1\n",
      "I received my new iPhone 7 today(17th-May'17) at 11:30 AM, when i tried to turn it on it wasn't turning on i tried everything possible like press & hold the power key for 2 to 5 secs, also Press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power key together for 15 to 20 seconds but noting worked out. I called the Flipkart customer service immediately and they informed me as the iPhone 7 new & might not be charged hence they suggested me to put it on charge for couple of hours & try to turn it on after that. I charged it for more than 2 hours 30 mins & tried to switch it on using the same way but it didn't, once again i called Flipkart customer server & this time they suggested me to visit the near by Authorized Apple store & get it checked. I visited Apex Apple store which is at Paradise Secunderabad near to Parklane hotel & informed them about the problem with my brand new iPhone 7, they tested it & confirmed that my brand new iPhone 7 is faulty hence suggested to inform the same to Flipkart immediately. While leaving from Apex Apple store i requested them to check for the warranty once, they removed the sim slot & entered numbers on it to the Apple website after that i was in big shock when they informed me that my new iPhone 7 is showing that its under warranty only for 307 days. They(Apex) said when the brand new iPhone 7 isn't turn on & activated yet then why its showing that warranty as 307 days & if its showing like that then it means its used one. I had to call Flipkart once again & informed them about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just can't believe that such a electronic commerce company called Flipkart who is celebrating its 10th anniversary can deliver such faulty & used products to their customers. Now all i want Flipkart to do is return back the amount & my old iPhone & take away their BRAND NEW FAULTY USED iPHONE 7.\n",

      "Secondly let's talk about Flipkart delivery. I just want to say if end is well then all well but Flipkart should introduce more transparency in there delivery system to save customer from a nightmare like situation specifically around such big sales. My product got delayed by a week no body was able to give me clear picture that why it is delaying and when it is going to be delivered. So I'm hoping that next time Flipkart is going to manage there delivery part much efficiently.\n",

Battery back is also good considering 62% when turned on from pack and undergoing heavy usage like downloading apps, transferring data, configuring, et cetra.. Apps runs smooth in A10 processor.

Bigger screen looks and feels brilliant, new home button is lightening quick, and both cameras are nothing short of amazing! Of course, water and dust resistance makes the 7 a better bet for a constant traveller like me. Force touch and intuitiveness are fantastic too.

      "The stereo speakers at the bottom make a superior audio quality, though not that loud\n",

      "I owned the iPhone 6 for almost 2 years. Fast forward to May 17,and Flipkart starts the Big Billion Sale,putting this phone at a staggering price of 38500/-It was a deal I just couldn't let go off and hence made the jump to IPhone 7.\n",
      "About the device:\n",
      "1) My iPhone 6 had started to feel sluggish after iOS 10 releases and the 16gb storage was a real pain. This phone is a beast,when it comes to performance,everything just feels butter smooth and swift.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) iPhone 6 has a good display,but the one on this is class apart,at first you might think it is yellowish,but there is an entire colour palette which could not be distinguished before,now comes to notice. You have to spend some time to experience it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The iPhone 7 rocks a 12 mp rear and 7 mp front camera which seems good,like it takes better photos obviously with a higher resolution but for all you folks who want a distinct camera experience go for the 7 plus. However that being said the one on this won't disappoint you in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The home button,seems so so so better than the physical one on the 6,that I tend to check my phone more frequently than ever just to feel it. The 3D Touch I know it's there,but I forget to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) The stereo setup and the new haptic engine really make the ringtones seem way different than iPhone 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's all,this might be a familiar looking design and an incremental update to the iPhone 6,without any mid blowing features,but then as the ad says it's does all the things in a better way than the previous generation. It might not have anything that really sets itself apart from the 6 line up,apart from water resistance and stereo speakers,but be rest assured it's an awesome phone and it will fly through everything you put at it.\n",

The battery life has been amazing even though it has been just under 24 hours of use. The major improvement is in the camera. It has been improved significantly and can capture some stunning photos. The absence of a headphone jack doesn't bother me because I am use to using bluetooth headphones and when I need to i can use the included lighting ear pods. If your planning to buy this phone then its a no brainer. The phone is fantastic and the experience is one of a kind.\n",

      "I've purchased iPhone 7 in October 2017, I found the product packaging was excellent and I exchanged my old iPhone 5S with it so got pretty good discount while purchasing iPhone 7. Its more than a year & I haven't faced any issues / complaints with this phone yet. It responds quickly, works well, few people complaints that the battery gets heated, but I haven't faced this issue yet. I make around 50-70 calls a day and get incoming calls in same way, I am social media guy so I do a lot of things too in a day, but I haven't found heating problem yet. the battery life is also satisfactory.\n",

      "Writing this review after about one month of purchase, Flipkart delivery was quick and neat. I took this phone at the time of Big Billion days...... I moved from Android to iOS mainly for security reasons. Although this phone is old and dates at the moment, I am ok with that. Wish apple gives more cloud storage for free, but we know how apple wants us to pay for everything .... Coming to the phone it's a great phone and I got it within my budget, iOS has really cool features which most of apple users don't know, they simply buy it for the name. But if you explore you will get so much of customisation options and the processing speed is also great. Design is just amazing. Except for the fact that phone takes a lot of time to charge I have no complaints.... Instead of buying an Android of 10K for every year you can invest in an apple for 3-4 years easily. This cost me 30K.\n",

I checked the serial number on apple website. I don’t know if there is any other trick. Anyway it works fine, Camera Good, as my current xperia XA1, audio through ear pods is great. display and touch feel is good. Not as user friendly as android. May be much secured. It is supposed to have VoLTE, but my vodafone sim switches to 3g from 4g when making calls. I think volte is not working. My place is in Kerala, vodafone says they have volte here, and apple says they have volte from iphone 6 onwards. But neither seems to be good for me. Any way good phone, if you have no heart crushing feel when spending cash. Go for 128 GB as net research says it have better faster hardware for memory.\n",

      "The IPhone 7 is a joy to use in my hands. I am seeing the difference as to why people stick with Apple once they buy a IPhone, a phone that 3 years outdated and still performing on par with the latest phones, you can’t deny that they know what they’re doing. I’m definitely going to stay with Apple for the future. I brought the phone for a cut price steal deal of 30k on BBD. The battery gives you a full day throughput, no issues there, the display is good and the phone housing is just a pleasure to hold in my hands. The apps available for the iPhone can’t be compared to that of the android, they’re specifically build for this machine. A big thumbs up don’t worry about storage you can manage it easily and if you think should I buy this phone even though it’s 2 years outdated, go in blindly the iPhone 7 will officially get supported till 2021 and the phone will have the latest IOS version.\n",

      "I recently purchased this iphone (currently running IOS 12.0.1), Everything is perfect only batery backup is worse. If you are game lover then this iphone js not for you. I installed PUBG and while playing battery is draining like water running from an open tap. I played this game for 1 hour and batery drain from 90% to 45% in an hour (in power saving mode). Batery back up is worse. Camera is superb even at night this capture good pictures, but if you click selfie it save mirror image and u cant change that setting. hope in next update this will rectify. performance is superb bt sometime I felt little heat while playing heavy games, looks of this iphone is stunning, screen size is little small. . All i wanna say if u are not a heavy phone user then go for it otherwise you have to carry power bank everytime everywhere. Most of the time my iphone is always pluged to charger.

Camera is superb (not like oneplus5 or iphone 7plus but works very well with minor quality difference). If you are a fan of apple, dont wait just go for it.

This time round I have paid around Rs.24,000 to upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7. And considering the fact, that I want to limit my spending on phones on an yearly basis to less than Rs.40,000 -Undoubtedly the Flipkart exchange offer along with the credit card offers of sale-come no less than a boon for me in this time of inflation.

On review of the said problem, I found that certain settings are required to be changed. On following the said steps, the yellowish screen minimized to that extent. However with Iphone being such a huge and expensive brand, as a customer default view should have been at its best. Iphone Co. Should accordingly work upon in their coming versions. Flipkart did its best and made the genuine supplier supply the genuine product. The product was worth buying at such discounted price of 39K, which otherwise is available in stores at 47-49K.

      "Honestly this was a birthday gift that I wanted and its the last phone from my dad, and I wanted to buy the best in my budget, since I was upgrading from an iPhone 5s, the 7 was a no brainier for me, so I eagerly waited for the Big Billion Day sale and placed my order on 21st of September and my birthday was the next day and Flipkart was gonna deliver it the next day itself. Sadly the phone delivery was delayed by a day which was kinda disappointing as I waited an entire day for it, but overall no problems.\n",

      "The next day (23rd) I received the device in the evening and was happy with the packaging and everything, the phone of course is really good and Im typing this review on it and to be honest, the headphone jack is not so much of a problem for me, and for the price I got this phone for (39k) I am really happy I made the right choice and right time to buy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I didnt expect to wait an entire day and get the phone the next day, overall the ordering process was smooth and the device is worth every penny I spent. Go for it if there is a sale again and you wont be disappointed!\n",

Yes it's a bit expensive but it is absolutely worth it, much better than buying a chinese brand for a few thousands less. When it is apple you can blindly trust the product, super good. Although the design is a bit disappointing as it is very similar to its predecessor. 4.5/5 for me.\n",

Won't comment too much on performance as even 6 was great for me and 7 looks amazing to. Haven't utilised it in a way where I can comment on performance but it's pretty smooth to function. The new speakers and much better. If you play music simultaneously on 6S and 7, you won't even hear what's being played on 6S. The lack of 3.5mm jack is noticeable as I use Bose Earphones instead of EarPods and it's tedious to use the connecter in between plus also hampers sound quality (The Air Pods aren't available yet).\n",
      "Lastly, summing it up, if you have a 6S, don't upgrade to this. It might be worth skipping this variant in between. If you have a 6 and don't like the 3D Touch, skip this model. Else just grab it whenever you can get your hands on it.\n",

So apple is now no more responsible to cover its warranty . I confessed that I never opened it or went to any unauthorised service centre since it is under warranty . On reply they told you never know what happened with the device before you bought it . And I am not the first to buy it online for saving some money and end up facing this problem . According to them these online platforms buys the rejected products / exchanged products and sells them saying new .. I bought around 7-8 mobiles from Flipkart but had to face this kind of situation for the first time .\n",

Not a great sign, especially for the fastest Iphone, I only got Insta and Whatsapp installed as resource consuming apps. Though it looks like a glitch nothing more. The device is not worth for 60K anyway, if you get decent cash back offer, price around 50K is more sensible.\n",

Amazing display though 750p sounds like very less compare compare to android these days but after looking at this screen you won't complaint.. this is not bad at all. Gaming experience is really lot better than iOS as some of the exclusive titles were really really good. Speaker volume is extremely good while browsing YouTube. Call quality is just too good excellent. Battery won't let you down. And not having the 3.5mm jack absolutely no problem the inbox EarPods were amazing but you won't better wireless experience buy Brainwaivz Blu-200 amazingly Bluetooth earphones with awesome audio quality is a perfect match for iPhone 7. In the end I must say I really enjoy iOS experience overall.\n",

A total package for people who love to play games on their phones without any issues relating to hanging of phone or battery issues. The version 7 has improved in terms of camera quality , the camera is much better in night mode with better exposure and brightness as compared to iPhone 6s. The removal of jack does not create any problem as the lightening connector continues to make life simpler here. The black Color of the phone has changed from dark black to matte black with a super sexy look and moreover the risk of stratches on the back is totally nullified. The phone is slimmer and lighter now. Overall with the cash back and the exchange offer on flipkart the iphone 7 is totally a win win case. So happy to own one. !\n",

I did not find any very big difference in this phone but I don't use iphone that much my main phone is android. Good camera good shot in tubelight without flash. Will post a detailed review later.

      "One of the rare sensibly priced iPhone which still works brilliant with the latest iOS release. Camera, Speed, Interface fluidity, display and average battery are it's strength. IP rating and price now is good but still, overall not worth 25k. Apple's ecosystem is good but it feels dated now and needs an overhaul. Lack of 3.5 mm audio jack is anti-consumer but, now is a trend limiting our choice and forcing to go wireless. Overall, still worth it if Apple is what one needs. This is good for basic use, anyone looking for long term use should consider iPhone 8 64 GB or 128 GB iPhone 7 for future proofing.\n",

      "The iPhone 7 was a great phone when it first came out, but it's now pushing two years old. The main reason why you would want to invest in an iPhone 7 is that the iPhone X is too expensive and iPhone 8 only has a very insignificant spec bump. Lets recap some of the features that you would get which dont exist in the previous generations of iPhones:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Storage - Apple increased the base storage from 16 gigabyte to 32 gigabyte. If you are looking to buy the base variant, you wont feel a dearth of storage.\n",
      "2. Design - The iPhone 7 comes in all new jet black finish which is extremely premium. Apart from this, the matte black variant is also very sleek.\n",
      "3. New Home Button - The new home button is a capacitive touch based taptic feedback button which responds to pressure sensitivity. It makes the button feel more tactile and is a great everyday experience.\n",
      "4. Water resistance - The iPhone 7 is now IP67 rated and is resistant to dust and water as per the rating standards.\n",
      "5. Display - Apple claims that the iPhone 7 display now has a wider color gamut as compared to the previous generations which allows it to reproduce brighter, more intense shades of colour. And as an extra bonus, its panel is now a claimed 25% brighter than the display on the iPhone 6S.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS: The current listed price on flipkart is 49,000 INR which is a little on the higher side, but moreover since the price between iPhone 7 & 8 is about 15,000 INR it is wise to invest in iPhone 7 than 8.\n",

      "Its a great phone if you are gettting into the ios ecosystem after using android it wont dissapoint you,this phone is like an old nokia feature phone in a good manner which lets you do anything you want,open any apps with in a spilt of second,its camera is one of the best in 2017. I would say after pixel it has the best camera, it has great battery life uptill now it gave around 8-9 hrs screen usage if used on low power mode though i would say go for the 7plus if your budget permits and it feels really weird after using galaxy note 4 though you would get habituated with the screen size after a while.I would also recommend get a midrange android phone as you will be using best of the both worlds.The charger that is provided is really slow only 1amp so throw that into the garbage and buy yourself an aukey quick charger though iphone will not support qualcomm quick charge 2.0 but it will charge fast from 0-80% with in 50 mins though it gets heated up which is normal.And another thing which is really annoying is to find the 3.5 mm headphone adapter whenever i need to plug in my headphnones as i dont use the stock headphones as it is really not that great.Never faced any performance issue after using for 2 months and its performance is just like new when i got.\n",

After few times problems started to appear. I have booked apple 7, and received defective product. And when replaced it was not only defective but it was used product, there was not at all shining on the body and looking very used... Wat kind of service is this and also the technician who comes is hopeless without any knowledge of product.. Very poor service through flipkart.. Hopless.. And customer care are also not responding...\n",

      "1. It has a taptic engine based soft home button so the feedback response is quick and I am happy to get off the 3.5 mm audio jack to fit in this engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Its much faster and night photography is much cleared and crisper, thanks to the 1.8f rear camera which is an upgrade from the 2.2f camera in 6s.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The audio driver is much better and as such the audio quality is much clearer from 6s.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It has dual speakers at top and bottom and the sound output is much louder and better than 6s.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Already a big fan of the jet black color i got.\n",

Just for the info i am no gamer. Takes around 3 hrs to full charge down from 1 percent. Battery capacity is now reduced to 90. Headsets has become quieter. Overall usage experience is fine. Bought this for 24k on Flipkart under offer scheme. Hope my review will be helpful !\n",

Un believable quality from a premium phone and premium seller . I doubt Shreyash Retail Private Limited in Bhiwandi had given me thru Flip kart a 3rd class product . This is my official phone and to day I spent extra 15000 to buy an alternate phone . I can only receive and do calla or Whatsup . My Official mail is not able to compact in alteranate set since this will take more time . At ;least 5 -6 days I lost my offical mail connectivty and will effect a lot in my official work . I demand for an immediate replacement for this with a new I phone 7\n",

Now i realized dat 4.7 is more than enough. This is an honest review. Now, regarding the quality of service by flipkart, i must say dat i recvd an 100% new and genuine product. Thanks flipkart.\n",

There was a deal of 32k during feb 2018, was a very good discounted price that time and got a great exchange value too on my old mi phone.

Yes it is expensive but it is justified as Apple is known to make high quality phone. As I am both an iOS and android phone user I can say with experience that iPhone is way better built than any other of its competiton. I have an 4 years old iPhone 5 which works perfectly, same as the day I bought it. I am sure this will work equally well.

However, although Flipkart has promised one day delivery on 16-10-2017, actually delivered the product on 17-10-2017 (Dhanteras). The IPhone 7 is an awesome product. I am using for last 7 days and I am extremely happy with it. Wish to say thanks to Flipkart for the best deal on Iphone. Definitely recommend for buying.\n",

      "Please do not buy an iphone online. I bought iphone7 32gb from flipkart which started having problems within the first week itself. I thought it is a network issue but later realized that the hardware has a problem. The receiver of the phone gets blocked real bad in 1-2 calls out of 12-15 calls. My ear has started to pain and it seems that the phone will explode. Apple provides only telephone support which does no good to the hardware. I followed all the instructions they provided but still I had to send my phone to Patna(nearest service center) which is 250kms from my place one side. And the person there tells that he cannot repair it until i showed him the problem (which is acceptable) but the problem happens with 1-2 calls out of 12-15, which i wasn't able to prove. Not practical for anyone to stay there the entire day to show the blocking problem. Now have to travel back again 250kms(500kms one trip) and god knows if my phone will have a problem again then i'll have to come back again for the same problem. Facing the problem of not being able to prove myself right again. Makes me feel that i've made a fool out of myself on buying iphone.\n",

      "Apple haters can say anything, well they say only 2 things, customisation and price, I am not a typical customisation guy, for me things have to work out of box as expected and it should be updated always. Data security is most important. After seeing lots of YouTube reviews I bought Samsung Galaxy S7, For one week it was cool, After that it starts to feel like another android device, Latest features only on paper no refinements, Bad UI, For any consumer device design and usability matters, well felt like it not refined just like skin over android, a lot of background services. Bad camera - in low light and back object appear below average. You can't download or update apps on roaming cellular network. I thought to exchange it with iPhone no luck on Flipkart there is not S7 option on SAMSUNG category, Outside no value for secondhand android device so I gave device brother and Bought iPhone 7. I am using a Mac as my system both work together great. As always fell grate on hands, Awesome UI, much refined apps, Better image rendering, Best security integration with apps, message grate, 1.5 days of battery backup on medium internet usage, Automatic back of all call history from old to new apple device, free apple apps as Garageband, move, 4K video shooting and more on I am loving it\n",

      "About iPhone 7, needless to say, its one of the best Smartphones around. No matter what other brands flaunt about.. Octacore, plenty of RAM, Camera or whatsoever.. nothing can match Apple products..! They are one of the finest engineered products around. They may seem less when specs are compared with others, but when it comes to Build Quality, OS Security, Stability, Product refinement & Reliability, Apple iPhone 7 stands a class apart.! This is my second iPhone after 6s & believe me I couldnt leave iOS. This is a phone for serious people & not for those who would always be happy fiddling with cheap apps, playing with funny themes, fonts, transferring media every hour & so on.. iOS is just not interested in cheap funny fonts & themes..!! Its much beyond.. which Andriods can simply never reach.\n",

But coming to Flipkart's delivery it has been an awesome experience, Ekart was prompt in delivering the phone the day it was launched. In fact they had gone an extra mile to deliver the product to a different location as initially ordered since it had become wee hours of the day. Kudos to Flipkart and Ekart team with the hope that they will continue this performance next time round as well.\n",

I am fortunate enough that I saw it. I am really very disappointment with the flipkart services. You guys claim to be the official partner of the Apple iPhone 7 and does this. First, the phone was to be delivered in 1 day and then next day I got to know my package had gone to the delivery boy of the other area and that meant I will not get it that day. And next day when I again received the message that the phone will be delivered, the message did not had the contact number of the delivery, I mean that's awesome, a person investing 60k on a phone at your site is one of the most stupid person in the world. He has no right to track his order over phone. And to top it all, the very intelligent delivery boy dint even bother to ca;; the customer to receive the IPHONE7, he just handed it over to watchman and went. What the hell, am I buying a rubber band from you portal that he wont bother to call the customer, why are you guys ask for our phone numbers then. I have requested for a replacement now and I hope if you guys have some sort of respect left, you will do it at the earliest.\n",

Though it's a minor improvement over iPhone 6s but it's still a worthy upgrade. If one already owns an iPhone 6s they can skip this iteration and save money for next 10th anniversary edition.

      "Thought we could get a rare delivery from Bansal as their office is nearby. But just as we hit the bed, the Flipkart person called. He would be delivering in 5 minutes. We had a quick exchange based on IMEI and he was good to go. He also seemed to know the whole excitement of a new iPhone release and seemed to be quite happy to participate.\n",
      "It is a little early to write about the device. It is light and shiny enough to be considered bling! iOS has to be updated. Contacts transfer was automatic.\n",

      "All in all an Apple phone with the best of the Android world. At Apple prices though!\n",
      "While the media criticises Apple for similar devices, fact is that Apple continues to deliver excellent devices.\n",

Finally Apple brings us the iPhone 7 and really there nothing much to say about it since it's been real smooth and shall be for multiple years, and that's perhaps the most critical reason of people buying iphones at even this ridiculous price.\n",
      "Special mention to Flipkart.com they really outdid themselves on this one since the official release of the iPhone pan India was on the 7th Oct 7pm I was amazed to receive it at my doorstep at 9pm which is just astonishing, I was earlier regretting that I bought the phone online since I needed it on launch date but surprise surprise flipkart stumped me..... 10/10 for flipkart delivery team.\n",

But I have used a transparent cover which helps in showing the beauty of the phone and also protecting it from finger prints. Switching from 16 gb 6s to 128 gb is a good move as you get ample amount of storage and won't have to worry much about space left on your phone. FINAL VERDICT- Go for it as the best quality and service is only offered by Apple\n",

      "\n",
      "On 8th October when I was using the phone continuously I found out that its volume up and down buttons are not working. I called flipkart for exchange but they had product out of stock so it was not possible. I din't wanted refund as II got the product with a deal on Citibank and my offer would have have failed if I got it refunded. So i submitted phone to Apple Service center and getting it replaced from there. The problem I faced was that when you buy such a costly phone first thing you do is get it tempered glass and I got that done at a cost of 4000 Rs with cover. When the phone is getting replaced by Apple care I was asked to remove the tempered and those tempered glass cost will be beared again by me. nobody will take that cost on them (Apple or Flpikart) . Also when I wrote these queries to Flipkart for complain they automatically started refund process without consulting me. I had to call again and get it rejected. I am really dissapointed with the Flipkart services on this phone. Also their promotional offer to review this product within buying it in 24 hour to get 1000Rs voucher,I haven't received it nor anyone is listening to my complain. Really fedup with your services for the first time. Don't take this review as refund request again you idiots.\n",

Headphone jack is removed but in this model it's not Bluetooth, it's actually connected through lightning connector. Overall it's better priced with given 32gb as compared to iPhone 6s with introductory model of 16gb. Recommended buy and excellent experience assured :).

      "Product delivered on time, however it is important that you dont open up a product as soon as you receive it.

      "Outer box was damaged when i received the product and I was disappointed with Flipkart seller SupercomNet, I have notified Flipkart customer care about the issue. But they assured me that in case of any issues in the actual product they would initiate the return. With trust I opened up a box and happy and relieved to see that everything was in place including accessories and leaflets. But next day, phone screen started flickering and it was hanged until i forcefully restarted. I was panicked with entire episode and decided to initiate return and called flipkart CS team. CS team had asked to go to Apple for issues and i was frustrated with their solution. 10 days return policy is just luring customers to grab the order, rest i assure you that it is not easy to get your product returned. I fought with them, I had proofs of emails and images of damaged box which had strengthened my case and finally after 1 hr of call they had agreed for the replacement. Received the new product next day, I have started using it and hoping that there wont be any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting long story short, you can definitely buy Apple product from Flipkart however that should not be your first option. I guess for savings of couple of thousands there wont be any point of buying an expensive product from eCom sites . I am using Flipkart since last 5 yrs and It is saddening to see the deterioration in their buying and customer experience overall. I hope that Flipkart would tackle such issues more professionally in future, nobody wants to RETURN their product if there are no issues FLIPKART.\n",

Since the purchase was made only 5 days ago, i asked for a replacement. However, the flipkart service now says they can't do anything about it and I need to go to the Apple center which is too far for me. This would have been completely avoided if I purchased the phone from a physical store since I would have checked it for these starting issues. You can too save yourself a lot of pain if you check your device physically before the purchase. I know some of you may be thinking that it's normal and apple only should be handling such an issue. But the Flipkart purchase page says in bold : 10 days replacement. But no one tells the hidden clauses behind your purchase. So if you want to save yourself from some pain and embarrassment... Dont buy this from Flipkart. Their service is useless.\n",

Till 14th I didn't get any update whether the phone is dispatched or not. I made a call at the helpline number to confirm whether I will get the phone delivered on 14th or not. The executive promised me that your will get the phone on 14th itself. Unfortunately the phone was not delivered on 14th. Later on 16th October I received a message and email saying there will be a delay in the delivery for the same product. Eventually I received the product on 21st October which was very disappointing as I sold my smartphone considering I will get it delivered on 14th October.\n",
      "Another worst experience I had was that I found a pamphlet in the delivery mentioning you will get ₹1000 gift voucher if you will download the flipkart application on your iOS. I followed the procedure but nothing happened. Later I called at the service centre regarding the same issue where I was being told that you will have to write a review from from you application only you downloaded on your iOS. I tried posting the review but there was no write a review option available on flipkart app. I again called to customer care number for help where they told me to wait for us to come back till 24th October. I waited till 27th of october when I got a call from one of your executives saying we are sorry there's no write a review option available on iOS app which was hell disappointing! The executive then asked me to write a review from desktop which I'm doing now just for ₹1000 GV! Highly unprofessional you guys are!\n",

I had order iPhone 7 128gb in jet black colour and when I received the phone today I was shocked to see that they have delivered a fake product to me. Box is of Jet black colour but inside it was matte black with so many scratches on the handset and the worst part is that this fraud seller & flipkart has got the display replaced to the local one from the original and the colour of the display is 'white' and the phone is not getting on also. There is a gap between the body & the screen because of this local screen which they have replaced. Screws of this iphone are looking used too. Clearly they are doing fraud with the people in a day light. Hand free is also missing from the box & there was not any seal even. I have raised the issue with flipkart customer care now let's see what will they do...I have requested them for a refund, if they don't provide me a refund than for sure I'll take this fraud ahead legally and would file a FIR against both this seller 'supercomnet' & 'flipkart'....so guys please think 1k times before buying some product from flipkart & this seller.\n",

      "- no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones.\n",
      "-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue.\n",

It's the last mile of user experience where none dares to enter, Apple hits it for a sixer. I still remember the wow experience I had when I got my iPhone 3 back in 2009 after using a HTC windows smart phone for couple of years, it's the similar experience now after I moved to iPhone 7 after using Nexus 4 for last three years. It was cool to see the finger print based authentication, crisp videos, and markedly better pic quality. Looking forward to use time lapse and slo-mo features. Thanks flipkart for delivering it on the very first day of it's launch in India. As usual, you stand out when it comes to customer service.\n",
